OVERVIEW:

This project is an analysis software for the Baby Associated Built Environment Microbiome Project (BABE Project).

It takes data from a sensor which measures temperature, humidity, and beam breaks whenever a door is opened. The software will return a summary of a single rooms data to the terminal and produce save-able graphs of the data.

To use type "python tool.py" in the terminal after selecting the project directory.

When asked for room number enter an integer. You must have already placed the appropriate files in the rooms respective folder. 


DATA STRUCTURE:

The temperature and humidity data from each sensor is stored in one while (TH_roomnumber.txt) and the beam break data is stored in another (BB_roomnumber.txt) where roomnumber the assigned number to the room.

Store data for each room in its respective directory within the data folder. For example data from room 20 would go in “data/room/20/“.

SCRIPTS:

Scripts used to analyse the data can be found in the scripts directory. The main file “tool.py” is runs all the scripts to produce graphs and analysis.

REQUIREMENTS:
Python 2.7.10 or greater
MatPlotLib
Num.py
