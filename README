OVERVIEW:

This project is an analysis software for the Baby Associated Built Environment Microbiome Project (BABE Project).

It takes data from sensors which measures temperature, humidity, and beam breaks whenever a door is opened. The software will return a summary of all available room data to the terminal and produce save-able graphs of the data.

To use type "python allRooms.py" in the terminal after selecting the project directory.

You must have already placed the appropriate files in the rooms folder. 


DATA STRUCTURE:

The temperature and humidity data from each sensor is stored in one  file (TH_roomnumber.txt) and the beam break data is stored in another (BB_roomnumber.txt) where roomnumber the assigned number to the room. (e.g. “BB_21.txt”)

Store data for each room in its respective directory within the data folder. For example data from room 20 would go in “data/room/20/“.

SCRIPTS:

Scripts used to analyse the data can be found in the scripts directory. To analyze data from individual rooms run "roomData.py" for an analysis of all rooms run "allRooms.py". Currently allRoom.py only returns average temperature of all rooms and room usages.

REQUIREMENTS:
Python 2.7.10 or greater
MatPlotLib
Num.py
